Projects developed during my MotionCut internship.

**Project1: Emoji Mood Responder**

The Emoji Mood Responder is a simple and interactive Python program that asks the user how they're feeling and responds with a matching emoji and a positive message. Itâ€™s designed to be fun, friendly, and emotionally engaging, perfect for beginners to understand how dictionaries, user input, and conditionals work.

How It Works: 
1. A user is asked to input their current mood.
2. The program checks if the mood matches any predefined options (like "happy", "sad", "excited", etc.).
3. It then displays a suitable emoji and an uplifting message.
4. If the mood is not recognized, it still gives a kind default response.

Concepts Used: 
1. Python Dictionaries
2. String input handling
3. Conditional statements (if-else)
4. User interaction with input() and print()

**Project2: Fake Job Title Generator**

The Fake Job Title Generator is a creative and fun Python program that randomly generates absurd job titles like "Quantum Meme Ninja" or "Invisible Cloud Overlord." It's a great way to learn how to work with multiple lists and randomness while having fun!

How It Works: 
1. Three separate word lists are defined: adjectives, roles, and suffixes.
2. The program randomly selects one word from each list.
3. It combines the three into a single job title and displays it.
4. Users can continue generating as many funny job titles as they want.

Concepts Used: 
1. Python Lists
2. random.choice() from the random module
3. String formatting with f-strings
4. Loops and user input
