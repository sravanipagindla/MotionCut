Projects developed during my MotionCut internship.

**Project1: Emoji Mood Responder**

The Emoji Mood Responder is a simple and interactive Python program that asks the user how they're feeling and responds with a matching emoji and a positive message. Itâ€™s designed to be fun, friendly, and emotionally engaging, user input, and conditionals work.

How It Works: 
1. A user is asked to input their current mood.
2. The program checks if the mood matches any predefined options (like "happy", "sad", "excited", etc.).
3. It then displays a suitable emoji and an uplifting message.
4. If the mood is not recognized, it still gives a kind default response.

Concepts Used: 
1. Python Dictionaries
2. String input handling
3. Conditional statements (if-else)
4. User interaction with input() and print()

**Project2: Fake Job Title Generator**

The Fake Job Title Generator is a creative and fun Python program that randomly generates absurd job titles like "Quantum Meme Ninja" or "Invisible Cloud Overlord." It's a great way to learn how to work with multiple lists and randomness while having fun!

How It Works: 
1. Three separate word lists are defined: adjectives, roles, and suffixes.
2. The program randomly selects one word from each list.
3. It combines the three into a single job title and displays it.
4. Users can continue generating as many funny job titles as they want.

Concepts Used: 
1. Python Lists
2. random.choice() from the random module
3. String formatting with f-strings
4. Loops and user input

**Project 3: Festival Reminder Bot**

A simple Python reminder tool that notifies about upcoming festivals using desktop notifications.

How It Works: 
1. Loads festival names and dates from a local JSON file.
2. Sends a desktop notification if a festival is coming up within 3 days.
3. Lets users view, add, or update festivals via a menu.

Concepts Used: 
1. JSON file handling (load, save)
2. Date & time with datetime
3. Conditional logic and loops
4. Desktop notifications with plyer
5. Interactive menu using input() and print()

**Project 2: Auto Nickname Combiner**

A Python program that generates creative and personalized nicknames using first and last name.

How It Works: 
1. Takes your first and last name as input.
2. Combines different parts of your names in unique ways.
3. Adds random numbers and symbols for fun variations.
4. Lets you choose the style: short, fun, or formal.
5. Optionally saves the nicknames to a .txt file.

Concepts Used: 
1. String slicing and manipulation
2. random module
3. Conditional logic and user input
4. Writing to text files (with open)
5. Sets to avoid duplicate nicknames
